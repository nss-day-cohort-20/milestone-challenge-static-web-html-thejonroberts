						I am currently attending Nashville Software School to learn as much as possible about the craft of Software Development.  It is a six month, full stack program run by some very talented developers and educators.  Please visit the NSS site or contact me for more info.  This page shows some of what I have been working on at NSS.

					<h3>Podcasts</h3>
					<p>There are a few...  I got started with WTF. The next one that caught me was "You Are Not So Smart." Mostly cognitive bias/behavioral research as it applies to modern living. Warning: It can get depressing.  But don't worry, there are also cookies! "In the Weeds" is really good political policy talk. I will add more to this later.</p>

			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>
				I grew up in rural southern Indiana, near a small town named Bloomfield.  Our house was perched on a hill of a gravel road through a valley referred to as 'the American Bottoms' in eastern Greene County.
			</p>
			<p>
				The area is largely a 'bedroom community', and most people commute to Bloomington, IN to work.  For whatever reason, country life never appealed to me, and I took to the city as soon as I could.  I have since lived in Terre Haute, Bloomington, Chicago, Austin, and have settled, for a while at least, on Nashville.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have worked in a variety of fields in that time.  I graduated from Indiana University with a B.S. in Mathematics Education.  That's when I moved to Chicago and started working in bars and ended up bartending and managing a music venue, called the Mutiny.  I did that for quite a few years before moving to Austin and resuming teaching.  I had a rough year there, and decided to move a little closer to home.  A friend needed a roomie, so I headed to Nashville.
			</p>
			<p>
				I got a sales job with a pretty good company.  I never expected to end up in sales, but it was a tolerable work environment, and I was at least average at it.  Plus, I had a 401k and good benefits for the first time ever.  What a rush! ;) I met some great friends there, but it grew less and less tolerable as time went on.
			</p>
			<p>
				While all of this was happening, I was always telling myself I should learn how to code. My mom taught Computer Applications classes at the high school.  So we always had a computer and internet (dial-up until 2010--2010!!!), so I was very fortunate to have a decent exposure to tech growing up.  I eventually managed to build a moderately functional website for the venue I bartended at in my spare time.  I made a few runs at CodeAcademy and the like, but would always get distracted by... life.
			</p>
			<p>
				I had been researching "Coding Bootcamps" for a while when I found out about Nashville Software School.  I came to an info session.  John Wark gave us the works.  A guy who founded the school was talking passionately to a handful of people about its goals, patiently answering questions. It did not feel like a sales pitch, as some other info sessions had... I was extremely impressed--with John, yes, but more with the school's straightforward attitude and their approach to education.  Luckily, I was accepted...  Here we go!
